I excelled in the sciences from early on, placing first in my fourth-grade science fair.
At the time, I wasn’t sure about my career path, so I next took a position selling real estate.
Although I love my current role, I feel I’m now ready for a more challenging assignment and this position really excites me.
I think one of my greatest strengths is as a problem solver.
I have the ability to see a situation from different perspectives and I can get my work done even in the face of difficult obstacles.
I feel just as comfortable presenting to senior executives as I do mediating a conflict between junior team members.
I worked as a programmer in the past so I have that perspective of a developer and I think that they respect me for that.
