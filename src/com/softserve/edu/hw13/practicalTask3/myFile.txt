Emperor Marcus Aurelius sat on his horse, on the top of the command hill, with guards on each side to protect him.
He watched as the battle slowly progressed, and it became clear that the Roman army had won.
Marcus hoped it would be many years before they had to go to war again, certainly not before he died.
He had no wish to see another battle. He turned to his guards.
“I will leave now,” he said.
“I have seen enough.”
Maximus looked at his sword in the tree.
His face was covered with blood and mud.
The beat of his heart was beginning to slow down as the noise of the battle became quieter.
There were other sounds now—screams from the dying and cries for help.
A small bird flew down from the top of the tree and sat on Maximus’s sword.
Could it possibly be the same bird he had seen before the first explosion of battle?
That seemed like a hundred years ago.
He shook his head and reached for the sword.
The frightened bird flew away as Maximus pulled his sword out of the tree.
Across the field, doctors were trying to help any Roman soldiers who were still alive.
Other soldiers were walking slowly through the men on the ground, looking for Germans left alive and killing them quickly.
